scaling:  # ---------------------------------------------------------
          # Scaling factors applied AFTER generation.

          # ---------------------------------------------------------

                  # Recommended:

                  #   100 → integer scale (recommended for MILP)

                  # Increasing mu increases average production.
                  # Typical range: 3.0–4.5
    
    sigma: 0.6    # Dispersion parameter.
                  # Higher sigma → more heterogeneity.
                  # Typical range: 0.3–1.0

  net_ratio:

    # Net = Gross * ratio

    alpha: 2      # Shape parameter α.

                  # alpha < beta → skew toward lower net ratios.

  regime:
    # Production regime (e.g., maturity or decline state).
    # Regime ~ Beta(alpha, beta)
    distribution: beta
    alpha: 4
    beta: 2

    # adjust interpretation accordingly.

    w_r: 10           # Weight of risk in cost.
                      # Larger → risky wells are more expensive.

    w_p: 5            # Weight of (1 - priority).
