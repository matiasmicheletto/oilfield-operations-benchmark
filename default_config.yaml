rounding:  # --------------------------------------------------------
           # Number of decimal places for each generated variable.
           # If set to 0 → values become integers.
           # If >0 → floating-point values are preserved.
           # --------------------------------------------------------

  production: 0   # Gross and net production rounding.
                  # Recommended:
                  #   0 for MILP integer conditioning
                  #   2 for more realistic continuous values

  regime: 0       # Production regime rounding.
                  # Often set to 0 when scaled to 0–100.

  risk: 0         # Risk rounding.
                  # If scaling.risk = 100, use 0 (integer 0–100 scale).
                  # If no scaling, use 2–4 decimals.

  priority: 0     # Priority rounding.
                  # Same recommendation as risk.
  
  cost: 0         # Intervention cost rounding.
                  # 0 for integer MILP models.
                  # 2 if representing monetary values.


scaling:  # ---------------------------------------------------------
          # Scaling factors applied AFTER generation.
          # Used to improve MILP numerical conditioning.
          # Example: risk in [0,1] → scale 100 → [0,100].
          # ---------------------------------------------------------

  risk: 100       # Multiplies risk values.
                  # Recommended:
                  #   1   → keep in [0,1]
                  #   100 → integer scale (recommended for MILP)
  
  priority: 100   # Same logic as risk scaling.
  
  cost: 1         # Cost scaling.
                  # Increase if cost coefficients are too small.
                  # Often left as 1.
  
  regime: 100     # Regime scaling.
                  # Converts Beta(0,1) → 0–100 integer scale.


production:  # ------------------------------------------------------
             # Production-related distributions
             # ------------------------------------------------------

  gross:
    # G ~ LogNormal(mean, sigma)
    # Note: 'mu' is automatically mapped to 'mean' by the script
    distribution: lognormal

    mu: 3.8       # Location parameter (log scale).
                  # Increasing mu increases average production.
                  # Typical range: 3.0–4.5
    
    sigma: 0.6    # Dispersion parameter.
                  # Higher sigma → more heterogeneity.
                  # Typical range: 0.3–1.0

  net_ratio:
    # Ratio ~ Beta(alpha, beta)
    # Net = Gross * ratio
    distribution: beta
    alpha: 2      # Shape parameter α.
    beta: 3       # Shape parameter β.
                  # alpha < beta → skew toward lower net ratios.
                  # Common realistic range: alpha,beta ∈ [1,5]

  regime:
    # Production regime (e.g., maturity or decline state).
    # Regime ~ Beta(alpha, beta)
    distribution: beta
    alpha: 4
    beta: 2
                  # alpha > beta → skew toward higher regime values.
                  # Adjust to simulate early/late-life fields.


risk_priority:  # ---------------------------------------------------

    rho: 0.7        # Correlation strength with net production.
                      # Recommended: 0.5–0.9

                      # Similar interpretation as risk noise.

  cost:
    # Intervention cost model:
    # C = kappa + w_r * R + w_p * (1 - P)
    #
    # NOTE:
    # If R and P are scaled to 0–100,
    # adjust interpretation accordingly.

    w_r: 10           # Weight of risk in cost.
                      # Larger → risky wells are more expensive.

    w_p: 5            # Weight of (1 - priority).
                      # Larger → low-priority wells cost more.
